# Barber Project Backend
-----------
## Overview
-----------
Full CRUD and fully functional user authentication was achieved using DJango. 
User authentication was applied to the site, but is not being utilzed because authorization is not yet necessary.
Comments were applied to the site, but are not being utilized because the site is currently only for viewing barbers.
This website is used to simply browse for barbers at my local barber shop.
There is one route that is accessed upon opening the app which allows anyone to view the barbershop database. 

## Future Development
-----------
* Continue to add more barbers to my database.
* Implement comments.
* Implement ratings.
* Add a way to sort barbers by rating, location, and also have paid "barbers of the week/month" browsing option
* Add a feed to show recently rated barbers or recently added comments

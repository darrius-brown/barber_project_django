Full CRUD and fully functional user authentication was achieved using DJango. 
User authentication was applied to the site, but is not being utilzed because authorization is not yet necessary.
This website is used to simply browse for barbers at my local barber shop with hopes of being updated across the US in later development.
There is one route that is accessed upon opening the app which allows anyone to view the barbershop database.
